# Airbnb-Price-Prediction-Model

Libraries used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, sci-kit learn

Using an Airbnb listings data set, I predicted the price of an Airbnb using a supervised learning regression type problem. I prepared the data set using techniques including one-hot encoding, feature selection, and scaling. Then I completed model training using a GBDT and random forest model. I further improved the models by using grid search to finetune the max depth and n estimators hyperparameters. For evaluation, I used model selection to determine the best performing model as well as comparing RMSE and R^2 scores.
